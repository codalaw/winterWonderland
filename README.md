This is my day 1 contribution to my 100 days of coding challenge. ChatGPT was used for a lot of the animations,
such as the falling snow, lights and star. I wanted to create this small project as its the middle of december 
and thought that building a Christmas tree seemed like a good idea. I also wanted to see if it was possible to
animate snow falling on a website, which clearly it is. haha. Hope you enjoy.

I have been coding for 3.5 months.
